- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jmosx36
- 👀 I’m interested in learining how to code to one day contribute on emulation, web development and task automation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning php and python, currently moving to rust
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, still thinking on it (but that's the idea)
- 📫 How to reach me, only on YT for now
